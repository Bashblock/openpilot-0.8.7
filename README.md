This fork is hard-coded to my cars VIN and Tesla Radar. You may sub the params in manager.py, and line 108 in carcontroller.py,  with your radar. Also, for less errors on startup, change for your car in car_helpers.py
Toggle on VisionRadarToggle
  ```echo -n 1 >  /data/params/d/VisionRadarToggle```
  
If you get 'Cruise Fault' reboot the car slowly.
Community Toggle- ON.

Any other helpful notes I will leave here..

Big THANKS to @csouers for getting this all working!
